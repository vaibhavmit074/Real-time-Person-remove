# Disappearing-People - Person removal from complex backgrounds over time.
Removing people from complex backgrounds in real time using TensorFlow.js in the web browser using JavaScript.

## What can this do?

This code attempts to learn over time the makeup of the background of a video such that I can attempt to remove any humans from the scene. This is all happening in real time, in the browser, using TensorFlow.js. #MadeWithTFJS 

This is an experiment. It may not be perfect in all situations.
